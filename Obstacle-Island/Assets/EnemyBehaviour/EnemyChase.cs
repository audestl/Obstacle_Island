 /* THIS IS PART OF THE ENEMY BEHAVIOUR SERIES BY MARIE-ÈVE.

    The enemy is chasing the player when he gets too close.
     
     Please refer to the scene "EnemyBehaviourTest" in order to see this script in live action.
     
     HOW TO USE THIS SCRIPT :
      -- THIS SCRIPT HAS TO BE PUT ON AN ENEMY (NOT A PLAYER, THIS IS AN AI).
      -- THE LEVEL NEEDS A BAKED NAVMESH SURFACE.
      -- SET THE DISTANCE DETECTION VARIABLE TO DESIRED RADIUS.
      -- THE SCRIPT IS MADE TO RECOGNIZE ACTIVE PLAYER ACCORDING TO BECOME SCRIPT.

  IF YOU HAVE ANY QUESTIONS OR SEE ANY BUG PLEASE POST AN ISSUE IN THE GITHUB OR SEND ME A SLACK @Marie-Ève
